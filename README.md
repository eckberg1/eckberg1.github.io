# About Me

![profile](website_profile.jpg){: width="350px"}

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan working on plant community ecology with a focus on plant-insect interactions and global change. I studied at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio for my undergraduate degree where I majored in Biology with a minor in History. As an undergraduate, I did independent research projects on the macroecology of North and South American bryophytes and the plasticity of cyanogensis in *Sorghum bicolor*. When I'm not at work, I'm probably at the Ann Arbor District Library making some amateur art.
