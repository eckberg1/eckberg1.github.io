## Does insect herbivory affect the capacity of remaining species to compensate following dominant species loss? 

Since 2021 in an old field at Matthaei Botanical Garden in Ann Arbor, I, along with several University of Michigan undergraduates, have been studying the effect of the dominant species *Solidago canadensis* (Canada goldenrod) on the rest of the plant community and associated arthorpods via a dominant species removal experiment. More recently, I have been interested in the top down effects insect herbviores on plant community structure and ecosystem function. I factorially combine dominant species removal with spraying insecticide to quantify the independent and interactive effects of dominant species and insect herbivores on plant diversity and productivity. In particular, I investigate whether consumption of plant material by insects limits the extent to which remaining plant species are able to increase their biomass and maintain productivity in the face of *S. canadensis* loss.

## What are the combined and interactive effects of precipitation and insect herbivory on plant community structure and ecosystem function? 

At the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, Michigan I have established a precipitation and insect herbivory manipulation experiment. In an old-field ecosystem, I construcuted insect enclosures to control the presence and density of insect herbivores. Above these enclosures, I constructed rainout shelters designed to intercept 40% of incoming precipitation in order to simulate future precipitation patterns in northern Michigan. With this experimetnal design, I can evaluate the combined and interactive effects of altered precipitation and insect herbivory on plant community composition, functional diversity, and above ground biomass.

## The effect of nitrogen, warming, and grazing on plant functional traits in an alpine ecosystem. 

As part of the Plant Functional Traits Course, I have had the opportunity to work at the THREE-D experiment site in Aurland, Norway. In collaboration with researchers around the world, we developed a plant functional trait field collection strategy that would allow us to quantify the effect of mammalian grazing, nitrogen addition, and warming on plant functional diversity.
